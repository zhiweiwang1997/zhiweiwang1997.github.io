Zhi-wei Wang (ÁéãÂøó‰ºü) is a Ph.D. student at the School of Civil Engineering, Southeast University (China), supervised by Prof. Wen-ming Zhang (Âº†ÊñáÊòé), national high-level young talent in China. He was a visiting Ph.D. student at the Institute for Risk and Reliability, Leibniz Universit√§t Hannover in 2022-2023 (host: Prof. Dr-Ing. Michael Beer).

His research interests mainly focus on:

- **Joint probability distribution modeling using copulas with special emphasis on circular/directional variables**
 
- **Directional environmental contour method with uncertainty quantification: Estimation of design load combinations**

- **Bayesian optimization on Riemannian manifolds: Finding extreme responses on environmental contours**

- **Deep learning techniques used in bridges' structural health monitoring (SHM)**

- **Reliability analysis of cable-stayed bridges**
