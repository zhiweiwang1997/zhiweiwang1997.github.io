Zhi-wei Wang currently works as a Ph.D. student at the School of Civil Engineering, Southeast University (China). My research interest focuses on determining the joint design values of wind and thermal actions on long-span cable-stayed bridges, including: 

- joint distribution of wind speed, wind direction, and temperature; 

- reliability analysis of cable-stayed bridges; 

- environmental contours method; and 

- wind and temperature prediction based on machine learning.
